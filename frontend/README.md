# Raqam website

Next.js (App Router) site for the Raqam platform. Arabic only, right to left. It reads the platform API from its own
server; the browser never calls the API and never sees the site token.

## Local development

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill API_BASE_URL, API_SITE_TOKEN (same value as the backend), SITE_URL
npm ci
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:3000
```

The backend runs with `php artisan serve` (see the backend README). `/lab` holds design explorations: development
only, never indexed, a 404 in every production build.

## Checks

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build                # also fails if the browser bundle mentions the site token
```

Settings are server-only. A `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable whose name looks like a credential (TOKEN, SECRET, KEY, PASSWORD)
stops the build, and `scripts/check-client-bundle.mjs` scans the built browser files for the token name and value.
